Genesis is a toolkit for building worlds programatically. The central functional
unit of Genesis is the Map; a map is an arbitrarily sized piece of terrain, 
which may or may not contain bodies of water, mountain ranges complete with
volcanos and caverns, forests, and other natural features. If desired,
unnatural structures can be placed, such as cities, dungeons, and
other artifical or otherworldly features.
